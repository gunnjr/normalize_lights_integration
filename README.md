# Normalize Lights

Normalizes lighting attributes (currently brightness) so a single scalar control yields consistent visible results across mixed devices.

## Scope
- Virtual light entities that apply per-fixture transforms (LLV/HLD/curves).
- Optional room-level light that fans out normalized control to members.

## Status
- Early scaffold; not yet functional.
